       <p>Data collected by the National Survey of Children’s Health found that 17 percent of children age 18 and under in Maryland, roughly 204,000, were diagnosed with a developmental or behavioral condition in 2012. The results were relative to America as a whole.</p>
       <p>In January of 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated coverage to expand to mental health and substance abuse disorders as part of the broad Essential Health Benefits package. Since then, more children have been insured.</p>
       <p>The developments raise two questions: Are more children diagnosed with mental health conditions now that there’s increased access to care and professional help, and how does that affect availability of treatment?</p>
       <p>While results to the first question are still being quantified – with too little concrete evidence to suggest higher diagnostic rates – experts in the field recognize an increased demand for care in recent years.</p>
       <p>“From looking at past numbers, we are definitely busier than we have been,” said Jennifer Lynas, an admissions supervisor in the Pediatric Psychiatry division at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12 graphictext">
                <p>Before the Affordable Care Act, 8 percent of children in the U.S. were uninsured. For Maryland, the number was 5 percent. Since 2014, when the Essential Health Benefits "benchmark" plan was implemented, the rate of uninsured children dropped to 5 percent in the U.S. and 4 percent in Maryland.</p>
                <p>Although left in state's hands, the Essential Health Benefits set standards for 10 services, including mental and preventative health, which expanded coverage for pediatric care.</p>
                <p>As you can see, Maryland remains ahead of the curve when it comes to insuring children.</p>

      </div>
      <p>More access to coverage means more crowded clinics and longer waitlists.</p>
      <p>Even before the ACA, meeting the demand for children with mental health conditions had been difficult. While Maryland is more successful than most states, the low supply of pediatric professionals is still a problem, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.</p>

              <p>If you zoom in close to Maryland, you'll see Washington D.C. is the only place on the map in the green, which means there are more than 47 licensed psychiatrists per 100,000 children.</p>

     <p>Leandra Godoy, of the Children’s National Health System, is a licensed clinical psychologist who specializes in early childhood mental health. She said waiting lists for children are long and treatment can be inconsistent.</p>
     <p>“There’s a high turnover rate for a lot of the mental health staff,” Godoy said. “What you want is a therapist who can work with a family over time. Some are providing care services that are evidence-based or evidence-informed.”</p>
     <p>Switching doctors isn’t ideal, she explained, especially considering phsyciatrists, and in other cases physicians, are often the ones who first recognize the disorder.</p>

             <p>According to Kids Count Data Center, 204,000 children in Maryland were diagnosed with a behavioral or developmental condition in 2012. At 17 percent, the numbers are average relative to the U.S.

        <p>To put in perspective how prevalent pediatric mental conditions are, consider its costs in comparison with other health issues.</p>
        <p>According to a 2012 study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an division within the Department of Health and Human Services, treatment of pediatric mental disorders cost $13.9 billion that year. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma cost $8.3 billion and trauma-related disorders, $7.8 billion.</p>

           </div>
           <div class="col-sm-12 graphictext">
            <p>While exact numbers on children diagnosed with or receiving care for mental conditions since 2012 are difficult to find - stats are still coming in - costs indicate prevelance. (Numbers are from a report published by the Milbank Memorial Fund.)</p>
            <p>Pediatric mental disorders cost 13.9 billion dollars, nearly four billion more than asthma.</p>
            <p>Though there's progress to be made in diagnosing and treating children with mental health conditions, the ACA has increased access and raised awareness. Many professionals would suggest the stigma around mental health has been reduced since the law was signed.</p>
